        <h1>Understanding Market Cycles</h1>
        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 1.25rem;">A guide to recognizing patterns and making informed investment decisions</p>

        <p>
          Market cycles are one of the most fundamental concepts in investing, yet they're often misunderstood or ignored by investors focused on short-term gains. Understanding these cycles can provide valuable context for your investment decisions and help you maintain perspective during both bull and bear markets.
        </p>

        <h2>What Are Market Cycles?</h2>
        <p>
          Market cycles represent the recurring patterns of expansion and contraction in economic activity and asset prices. These cycles typically consist of four distinct phases: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough. While the duration and intensity of each cycle can vary significantly, the underlying pattern tends to repeat over time.
        </p>

        <h2>The Four Phases</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Expansion:</strong> During this phase, economic activity increases, corporate earnings grow, and asset prices generally rise. This is typically when investors feel most confident and markets see sustained upward trends.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Peak:</strong> The peak represents the transition point where growth begins to slow. Economic indicators may still be positive, but the rate of improvement starts to decelerate. This is often when markets are at their most optimistic—and potentially most vulnerable.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Contraction:</strong> In the contraction phase, economic activity declines, earnings may fall, and asset prices typically decrease. This is when fear and uncertainty dominate market sentiment, and many investors may be tempted to make emotional decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Trough:</strong> The trough is the bottom of the cycle, where economic activity and asset prices reach their lowest point before beginning to recover. This phase often presents opportunities for long-term investors, though it requires patience and discipline.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Cycles Matter</h2>
        <p>
          Recognizing where we are in a market cycle can help investors make more informed decisions about asset allocation, risk management, and timing. However, it's important to remember that cycles are not perfectly predictable, and attempting to time markets based solely on cycle analysis is extremely difficult.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, understanding cycles can help you:
        </p>

        <ul style="margin-left: var(--spacing-md); margin-bottom: var(--spacing-md); color: var(--text-secondary);">
          <li>Maintain perspective during market volatility</li>
          <li>Make more rational decisions when emotions run high</li>
          <li>Adjust your strategy based on broader economic conditions</li>
          <li>Recognize that both good and bad times are temporary</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          While you shouldn't try to perfectly time the market based on cycles, you can use this knowledge to inform your long-term strategy. During expansion phases, you might focus on growth opportunities while maintaining discipline. During contractions, you might look for value opportunities and ensure your portfolio can weather the downturn.
        </p>

        <p>
          The key is to maintain a long-term perspective, stay diversified, and avoid making drastic changes based on short-term cycle movements. Markets have historically recovered from every downturn, though the timing and path of recovery are never certain.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Market cycles are a natural part of investing, and understanding them can help you become a more informed and disciplined investor. By recognizing these patterns and maintaining a long-term perspective, you can navigate both the ups and downs of markets with greater confidence and clarity.
